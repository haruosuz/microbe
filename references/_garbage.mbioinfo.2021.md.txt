Eukaryotic mitochondrial SSB
The mitochondria of eukaryotic cells contain their own single stranded DNA binding protein. Human mitochondrial SSB (mtSSB) binds to single-stranded mitochondrial DNA as a tetramer and has sequence similarity to bacterial SSB.[7] Human mtSSB is encoded by the SSBP1 gene. In yeast, it is encoded by the RIM1 gene.[8]

New preprint from the 
@RnR_Lab
 !!  In this work, we identify and characterize the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) of one of our favorite viruses, the tectivirus Bam35. A great work of 
@Analema93
 and a great collaboration with 
@DariusBio
 (1/4)
The Bam35 SSB is encoded by viral gene 2 and it turned out to be a highly specific SSB, unable to bind other nucleic acid substrates. Moreover, ssDNA binding is highly cooperative and results in (unspecific) stimulation of DNA replication. (2/4)
Although diverse at the amino acid level, typical SSBs share a conserved structural domain, named OB-fold, present in all DNA binding proteins from all domains as well as DNA viruses. However, protein-primed viruses seemed an exception, as we didn't know any OB-fold SSB. (3/4)
Based on sensitive database searches we found that B35SSB belongs to a novel and independent group of SSBs, along with other protein-primed viral genomes like (surprise!) Φ29 and close podoviruses. (4/4)
BONUS TRACK: Structural predictions indicate that B35SSB contains a conserved domain resembling a divergent OB-fold, which would constitute the first occurrence of an OB-fold-like domain in a protein-primed genome.

Based on databases searches as well as phylogenetic and structural analyses, we showed that B35SSB belongs to a novel and independent group of SSBs. 

As expected from such a diverse dataset of short sequences, phylogeny reconstruction not always yielded confident clades (Figure 6). 

Figure 6.
B35SSB and Φ29 related viruses belong to the same clade of SSBs from protein-primed genomes.

Single stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) are highly conserved, essential proteins found in all kingdoms of life. These proteins bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affinity and low sequence specificity. They play a crucial role in processes involved in DNA metabolism like DNA repair, replication and recombination by modulating the functions of many DNA processing enzymes either by controlling the accessibility to ssDNA or via protein–protein interactions [1]. Several bacteria contain, next to the main SSB, a second SSB. 
The second SSB can either be found on the chromosome or is located on a plasmid. The presence of a second chromosomal paralog is often related to natural competence [2], [3], [4]. Furthermore, nearly all conjugative plasmids also encode an SSB homologue. The exact function of these SSBs is still unclear; they seem not to be necessary for conjugal transfer of the plasmids, but might be involved in plasmid stability [5]. Remarkably, the SSB homologue VirE2 encoded on the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid is essential for infection of the host plant cells [6], [7]. VirE2 is transported via the Type IV secretion system (T4SS) on the Ti plasmid independent of the ssDNA [8]. In the recipient cell, it probably functions as a molecular motor facilitating the import of the Ti ssDNA [9], [10].

For some phages, specific SSBs are involved in DNA replication and, in some cases are essential for phage development [20], [25]–[26]. Phylogenetic analysis of a number of bacterial and phage SSB proteins indicates that there have been frequent horizontal transfers from bacterial hosts to the genomes of their phages [27]. The bacterial origin of the phage ssb genes is easily recognized despite the high evolution rate of phages [24], [27]. Moreover, some phage SSBs are interchangeable with their bacterial analogs in vivo and in vitro [23], [28].

ABSTRACT
Bacteriophage P1 encodes a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB-P1), which shows 66% amino acid sequence identity to the SSB protein of the host bacterium Escherichia coli. 
系統解析
A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the P1 ssb gene coexists with its E. coli counterpart as an independent unit and does not represent a recent acquirement of the phage. The P1 and E. coli SSB proteins are fully functionally interchangeable. 

RESULTS
Phylogenetic analysis of ssb-P1.

The global distribution and spread of the mobilized colistin resistance gene mcr-1

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5862964/

Our analyses establish that all mcr-1 elements in circulation descend from the same initial mobilization of mcr-1 by an ISApl1 transposon in the mid 2000s (2002–2008; 95% highest posterior density), followed by a marked demographic expansion, which led to its current global distribution.

Results

Overview of the mcr-1-positive isolates included. a Global map of mcr-1-positive isolates included colored by genus with the number and size of pies providing the sample size per location; b Map of novel Chinese isolates sequenced for this study; c Histogram of sampling dates (years) of the isolates. Maps were created using the R package rworldmap using the public domain Natural Earth data set


Fig. 4
Phylogeny of the mcr-1 composite transposon indicates a dominant sequence type with subsequent diversification. Midpoint-rooted maximum parsimony phylogeny based on the 3522 bp alignment of 457 sequences (recombinant regions removed). Size of points indicates the number of identical sequences, with a representative sequence for each shown next to each tip


A Bayesian dating approach (BEAST) was applied to infer a timed phylogeny of the maximal alignable region of the mcr-1 carrying transposon (see Methods). Based on this 3522 site alignment we infer a common ancestor for 364 dated isolates in 2006 (Supplementary Fig. 3; 2002–2008 95% highest poster density (HPD) with a strict clock and coalescent model) with a mutation rate around 7.51 × 10−5 substitutions per site per year (Supplementary Table 1). There was no clear overall geographic clustering in the Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree (Supplementary Figure 4).



Fig. 5
The distribution of plasmid types shown on the transposon phylogeny. Maximum parsimony tree (homoplastic sites removed, midpoint rooted, as in Fig. 4) based on the composite transposon alignment for 172 sequences containing a plasmid replicon on the same contig i.e. those with an assigned plasmid type (color). IncI2 and IncX4 are the most common plasmid types. An example sequence ID is shown for each unique sequence


We applied BEAST to infer a timed phylogeny for each of these alignable regions after removal of SNPs showing evidence of recombination. For the IncI2 background we infer that a common ancestor to all 108 isolates existed in 2006 (1998–2010 95% CI relaxed exponential clock model) assuming a constant population size model (Supplementary Fig. 5). For the IncX4 backgrounds we dated the common ancestor of the eight isolates to 2011 (2010–2013 95% CI relaxed exponential clock model) assuming a constant population size model (Supplementary Fig. 6). Posterior density distributions of root dating under different population models are shown in Supplementary Figs. 7–8. The difference in dating inferred for these two plasmid backgrounds and the recent date obtained for IncX4 highlight the dynamic nature of the integration of the mcr-1 carrying transposon, even if in the IncX4 phylogeny isolates from East Asia and Europe and the Americas cluster together. The inferred mutation rates obtained for the IncI2 and IncX4 backgrounds consistently lie around 5–10 × 10−5 substitutions per site per year (Supplementary Table 1).


Discussion
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5862964/#Sec8title

Our phylogenetic analyses point to a date for the insertion of mcr-1 into the gene transposon shared across our isolates in the mid 2000s (2002–2008 95% HPD). 

Our estimates of the age of spread of the representative IncI2 and IncX4 plasmid backgrounds are more recent, dating to ~ 2008 and 2013, respectively, but are both consistent with the age of the transposon mobilization event. 


Methods
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5862964/#Sec9title

Phylogenetic dating
Given recombination can conceal the clonal phylogenetic signal we also applied ClonalFrameML52 to identify regions of high recombination in a subset of IncI2 and IncX4 plasmid background alignments. Where recombination hotspots were identified, they were removed from the alignment. In the IncI2 alignment, this resulted in removing 1281 positions. No regions of high recombination were detected in the IncX4 alignment. We applied root-to-tip correlations to test for a temporal signal in the data using TempEST55. There was a significantly positive slope for all three alignments (Supplementary Fig. 9–11).

We applied BEAUTi and BEAST v2.4.756,57 to estimate a timed phylogeny from an alignment of IncI2 plasmids (7161 sites, 110 isolates) and IncX4 plasmids (34,761 sites, 8 isolates).

The obligatory intracellular pathogens/symbionts and microorganisms surviving in nutrient-limiting environments are, in most cases, characterized by relatively small genomes of low G+C-content, apparently in attempt to reduce replication expenses [13, 14], while free-living organisms, especially of the ones surviving in the soil [6], usually possess much larger genomes of higher G+C-content.

- (Fig 1A). Surprisingly, the samples from farm soil and ocean surface water—both of which contain DNA from more than 1,000 diverse, non-abundant species (Venter et al, 2004; Tringe et al, 2005)—are very different, with the surface water sample having a GC-content median of around 34% and the soil sample around 61%.
- We found that the third codon position is even more extreme with respect to GC distribution than the average of all three positions (Fig 2, the median in farm soil is 74%, versus 24% in the ocean surface water).
